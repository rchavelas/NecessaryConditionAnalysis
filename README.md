# Necessary Condition Analysis in Python

Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) allows researchers and practitioners to identify necessary (but not sufficient) conditions in data sets.

This is a Python implementation of the original [NCA R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NCA/NCA.pdf) including only the basic functionality of NCA for users who want to have a native implementation in Python.

Please see the [getting started](https://nbviewer.org/gist/rchavelas/714e291a346a440d56d7eb1b3b31e722) jupyter notebook for a complete example of how to use the Necessary Condition Analysis in Python package.
